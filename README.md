# React + Tailwind Playground

Use this to mess around with Tailwind and React.

- `npm i && npm start` && have fun!

## The idea behind tailwind:

- when you first get your design, spend some time identifying key characteristics: margins, paddings, theme colors, fonts, etc
- customize your tailwind.config.js file to reflect those
- now building out your app is super-easy...because all your utility classes are custom-tailored to what you're trying to build!
